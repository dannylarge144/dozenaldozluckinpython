# dozenaldozluckinpython

This is the same game that you can find stored in dannylarge144/originaldozluck but with numbers represented to the user in dozenal. The numbers in this readme will also be represented in dozenal. The user and the computer go head to head rolling 100 sided dice at least one per round for 10 rounds. Highest number at the end wins. Rolling a prime awards an extra roll and ending up with a multiple of 10 doubles your score.
